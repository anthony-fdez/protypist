Protypist is a pretty cool typing website (I'm pretty biased here hehe)

A couple years ago when I decided I really wanted to type fast, I ran into a couple of websites that tought you how to do it, but I didn't like how any of them look, so I decided to make my own. (there are a lot of them now that look better than mine haha, monkeytype.com for example, its pretty cool)

I did learn how to type falst btw... well kinda
